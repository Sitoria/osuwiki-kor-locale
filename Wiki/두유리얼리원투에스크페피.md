# 정말로 peppy에게 물어보고 싶으신가요?

안녕하세요! peppy는 개인적으로 연락하고 싶은 여러분의 마음을 이해합니다만, 도움이나 지원을 요청하기 위한 것은 **아니라는 점**을 이해해 주시면 감사하겠습니다. 그는 osu! 서포트를 개인 메시지와 분리하여 계속 관리하고 있으며 포럼  He keeps osu! support separate from personal messages and also finds that answering forum PMs is quite hard to keep up with. He therefore asks that you do one of the following options:

## Technical Support

Most technical issues can be resolved by searching or posting in the [Help forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/5). There are lots of others there to help you with your issues, so you will find a solution faster than contacting him.

## General osu! support

For account issues, problems with payments, ban follow-ups, enquiries about tournaments and **anything related to needing help on osu!**, please contact the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) by sending an email to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) (account queries) or [osu@ppy.sh](mailto:osu@ppy.sh) (anything else).

## Contacting peppy

If you wish to contact peppy personally for non-osu! related reasons, you can email him at [pe@ppy.sh](mailto:pe@ppy.sh). Please be aware that any support or account-related requests to this email will be marked as spam.
