# 태그 (TAG)

**태그**는 a term used to describe [multiplayer](/wiki/Client/Interface/Multiplayer) team modes named [Tag Coop or Tag Team Vs](/wiki/Client/Interface/Multiplayer#tag-co-op-/-tag-team-vs) where players try to complete a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) cooperatively. Beatmaps that are specifically designed for those modes are usually referred to as **TAG beatmaps/difficulties**.

이 모드에서는, 각 플레이어 is responsible for one [comboset](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo), and throughout the song, players switch between combosets. For this reason, TAG beatmaps are designed in such a way that their combosets are placed much farther apart and more complex than usually, making it nearly impossible for the beatmap to be played by a single player.

TAG [난이도](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty)들은  usually denoted by the use of the term "TAG" in the beatmap difficulty name. Most often "TAG" will be followed by a number, which typically denotes how many players the difficulty is meant for (e.g. "TAG2" for two players or "TAG4" for four players).

이런 속성으로 인해, TAG 난이도는 unranked 상태가 되거나 [러브드](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved) 상태로 바뀌었으며, 솔로 플레이에서는 거의 불가능하도록 의도적으로 설계되었기 때문입니다.
